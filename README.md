# Investigation on Installing J-Pipe to Reduce Drone

# Introduction
About a year ago, I started working on my Mustang. The exhaust was way too quite, so I started swapping stock parts to 
aftermarket offerings. The complete list of current mod includes:
- Roush cold air intake
- Ford Racing after-cat X-Pipe
- Dual 18" glasspack
- Roush cat-back exhaust
- BAMA tune

After all the modification, the car sounds a lot more engaging and lively. However, with the modifications, the cabin
 starts to drone at some specific RPMs. 
 
 # What is "Drone"?
 Droning is a phenomenon of the car resonating with exhaust gas's frequency. It usually happens at highway cruising 
 speed. When it happens, you can feel the your cabin is vibrating at a low frequency.
